# kanban-board
This is a personal project focusing on frontend development. Kanban Board is a tool to organize your work and projects in a more efficient way. It enables users to create a new account and login to the platform, then manage their own cards(tasks) such as creating new cards, moving and deleting cards. 

I implement the login system from https://github.com/theshrewedshrew/login.git

Here's the live demo: http://kanban.stacysun.com/ 

Currently, I'm still working on the CRM system to fetch the user data.
